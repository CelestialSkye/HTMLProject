     The Lamborghini Egoista is a concept car unveiled by Lamborghini for the company's 50th anniversary. The fully functioning model is based on the Gallardo. It features a 5.2 L (317 cu in) V10 engine producing 600 hp (447 kW; 608 PS).[1]

     The Lamborghini Egoista has a unique one-seat cockpit, which is similar to that of a modern fighter jet, and has a canopy door that is completely removable. The steering wheel must be removed to enter and exit the vehicle like a Formula One car.

    Since 1963, Lamborghini has been staying true to its promise of creating only the best and most refined grand touring cars in the automotive industry. Lamborghini has produced some pretty impressive automobiles along its way, and in celebration of their 50th anniversary back in 2013, Lamborghini outdid itself with a concept car that rattled all other concept cars in their cages. The Lamborghini Egoista was that concept car, and it exists to this day only to remind us all of exactly what kind of manufacturer Lamborghini truly is

    Egoista literally stands for selfish in Italian. We’ll see why this is important later on, but first let's reminisce about that day this world bore witness to the Egoista for the very first time. It happened at Lamborghini's 50th Anniversary Gala in Sant’Agata Bolognese. The Egoista was unveiled on the last day of the amazing Grande Giro tour through Italy. According to Walter De Silva, VW’s head of design, the Lamborghini Egoista was “hedonism taken to the extreme.” It was a car made for pleasure but only for that of the driver’s alone. After it was revealed, truth in the statement came to light as it became apparent that the Egoista is made with only one cockpit—the one that will seat one driver and no one else.

  The Egoista’s constructed mostly of carbon fiber and aluminum that is coated in a radar-absorbent material to help keep the cops from clocking you while flying down the highway – fortunately, this is only a concept, so Lambo can do as it pleases with the coating. Orange highlights the car in various areas, including the super-styled wheels and inside the intakes. The oddest of the orange accents is the orange-tinted front windshield.
