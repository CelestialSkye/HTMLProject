   <p>

     he Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano (internal code F141) is a grand tourer produced by Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. It was the brand's front engined, two-seat flagship, replacing the 575M Maranello in 2006 as a 2007 model, and was replaced for the 2013 model year by the F12berlinetta.

Styled by Pininfarina under the direction of Ken Okuyama, the 599 GTB debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in February 2006. The bodywork features optimized aerodynamics with distinct sail panels flanking the rear window, directing and maximizing air flow to a linear rear nolder.[7]

The 599 is named for its total engine displacement 5,999 cc (6.0 L), Gran Turismo Berlinetta nature, and the Fiorano Circuit test track used by Ferrari.

  <p>
    he 6.0 L (5,999 cc) Tipo F140 C V12 engine utilised in the 599 produces a maximum power output of 620 PS (456 kW; 612 hp) between 7,600 rpm to 8,400 rpm, making it the most powerful series production Ferrari road car at the time. At the time of its introduction, this was one of the few engines whose output exceeded 100 hp (75 kW) per litre of displacement without any kind of forced-induction mechanism such as supercharging or turbocharging. Its 608 N⋅m (448 lb⋅ft) of torque produced at 5,600 rpm was also a record for Ferrari's GT cars. Most of the modifications to the engine were done to allow it to fit in the 599's engine bay (the original version used in the Ferrari Enzo would be taller as it would block forward vision due to its mid-mounted position construction).

  <P>
    The internal combustion engine, gearbox, turbo-charged air, battery pack and electric motors, the inverters and charging systems and brakes all need cooling. Meticulous attention was paid to the design of the engine bay which houses both the usual internal combustion engine systems that generate temperatures of nearly 900°C, and highly temperature-sensitive electronic components.

<p>
  The 599 came with a luxurious leather trimmed interior. The driver's seat was positioned slightly towards the centre in order to provide a better driving position. The instrument cluster was a combination of analogue gauges and screens. The foot paddles could either be optioned in aluminium or in carbon fibre and were affixed to the steering column. The three spoke steering wheel housed controls for the car's electronic systems as well as a starter button. The interior has a glove box, storage space in the door panels and combination of simple dials and buttons for operating the stereo, climate control and air conditioning. The car has a rear shelf and a boot-lid providing adequate boot space.
