    The Porsche Taycan is an all-electric car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche, which was first unveiled as a concept car named Mission E at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show[3] and then in production form at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show.[2] It is Porsche's first series production electric car,[3] and is planned to be sold in several variants of different performance levels, and it could spawn derivatives in a future line-up of models based on its platform.

  <P>
    The Taycan is built around the J1 platform which is a mixture of steel and aluminium joined together by different bonding techniques. The B pillars of the body, side roof frame and seat cross member are made from hot-formed steel while the bulkhead cross member is made from boron steel to improve safety. The shock absorber mounts, axle mounts and rear side members are made from forged aluminum, while all body panels except the front and rear bumpers are also made from aluminum to reduce weight. In total, 37% of the car is constructed of aluminium.

  The interior of the car is based around up to four digital displays, including a curved, free-standing 16.8 in configurable driver's display. This marks Porsche's first fully digital instrument binnacle. A 10.9 inch screen is situated to the right of the instrument binnacle which serves as the infotainment system of the car. An optional screen is placed to the right of the infotainment screen which allows the front passenger to customise the infotainment system. An 8.4 inch screen is present in a portrait layout on the centre console with a trackpad to control the functions. The screen displays the status of the powertrain and tells the driver to efficiently use the power. Despite using an all digital layout, the dashboard features the classic Porsche clock on the top.
